# The simulator is using TPC-H data which is public source that can scale to any size required.

- TPC-H data generator https://github.com/robert-s-lee/tpch-kit

- Workload simulator https://github.com/robert-s-lee/crdb-tpch-txn

# process flow

- crdb-tpch-txn.py combines orders and lineitem into a single transaction.  

Below can be used to generate upsert, insert on conflict, or insert DMLs

```sql
crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml upsert 
crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml ioc 
crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml insert
```
 
- Send to data with either Java or Python.  

```sql
./crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml upsert | ./senddb.py
./crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml upsert | java -cp ~/bin/postgresql-42.0.0.jar:./ senddb
./crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml upsert | psql "postgres://127.0.0.1:26257/tpch?sslmode=disable&user=root"

```

- Example

```sql
./crdb-tpch-txn.py -l 1000 --dml upsert | more
